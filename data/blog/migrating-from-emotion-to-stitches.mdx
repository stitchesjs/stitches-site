This post is about highlighting the main differences between [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) and [Stitches](/blog/introducing-stitches). Some of these differences are related to the authoring experience. Others are about what happens behind the scenes.

> **Disclaimer**: This post isn't about comparing which one is best. Emotion and Stitches are two different CSS-in-JS solutions with different concerns.

### API Differences

#### Importing the `styled` function

In Emotion, the `styled` function is a default import.

In Stitches, the `styled` function is a named import.

```jsx
// Emotion
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

// Stitches
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
```

#### Object Syntax Only

In Emotion, you can write CSS in template strings or in an object syntax.

In Stitches, you write CSS using the [object style](/docs/styling#object-syntax) syntax. The reasons for this are: performance, bundle size and developer experience (type checks and autocomplete suggestions for both properties and values).

```jsx
// Emotion (string syntax)
const Button = styled.button`
  color: red;
  font-size: 14px;
  :hover {
    color: black;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
`;

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '14px';
  '&:hover': {
    color: 'black',
    fontSize: '14px';
  },
});
```

#### Chaining selectors

In Emotion, pseudo-classes and pseudo-selectors are automatically chained to the scoped selector. However, other selectors, such as class or id selectors, require the `&` sign, otherwise they're considered descendants.

In Stitches, all chained selectors require the `&` sign.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  // chained
  :hover {
  }

  // chained
  ::before {
  }

  // descendant
  .class {
  }
`;

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  // all chained
  '&:hover': {},
  '&::before': {},
  '&.class': {},
});
```

#### Prop Interpolation vs Variants

In Emotion, you can interpolate the component's props to conditionally set styles.

In Stitches, we've introduced the concept of [variants](/docs/variants). You can conditionally apply variants at the consumption level, including at different breakpoints.

```jsx
// Emotion
const Button = styled.button`
  ${(props) =>
    props.color === 'violet' &&
    `
    background-color: 'blueviolet'
  `}

  ${(props) =>
    props.color === 'gray' &&
    `
    background-color: 'gainsboro'
  `}
`;

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  variants: {
    color: {
      violet: { backgroundColor: 'blueviolet' },
      gray: { backgroundColor: 'gainsboro' },
    },
  },
});

() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>;
```

#### Tokens and Themes

In Emotion, you can add a theme via the `<ThemeProvider/>`. For this, you need to install an additional `emotion-theming` package. The theme gets injected to every component, and you can access it via prop interpolation.

In Stitches, you can [define tokens](/docs/tokens) in the config file and seamlessly consume and access directly in the Style Object.

```jsx
// Emotion
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';

() => (
  <ThemeProvider
    theme={{
      colors: {
        red500: 'tomato',
      },
      space: {
        1: '5px',
        2: '10px',
      },
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

const Button = styled.button`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.red500};
  margin: ${(props) => `${props.theme.space[1]} ${props.theme.space[2]`};
`;

// Stitches
const { styled } = createStitches({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      red500: 'tomato',
    },
    space: {
      1: '5px',
      2: '10px',
    },
  },
});

const Button = styled('button', {
  color: '$red500',
  margin: '$1 $2',
});
```

#### Responsive Styles

In Emotion, you can add at-rules directly in the CSS.

In Stitches, you can do the same. But you can also [define breakpoints](/docs/responsive-styles) in the `media` object and access directly in the Style Object.

```jsx
// Emotion
const Box = styled.div`
  padding: 12px;

  @media (min-width: 480px) {
    padding: 24px;
  }
`;

// Stitches
const { styled } = createStitches({
  media: {
    '@bp1': '(min-width: 480px)',
  },
});

const Box = styled('div', {
  padding: '12px',

  '@bp1': {
    padding: '24px',
  },
});
```

#### Global Styles

In Emotion, you can add global styles with the `Global` component from the `@emotion-core` package.

In Stitches, you can use the `global` API. Learn more [here](/docs/api#global).

```jsx
// Emotion
import { Global } from '@emotion/core';

export function EmotionApp() => (
  <>
    <Global
      styled={{
        body: { margin: '0' },
      }}
    />
  </>
);

// Stitches
import { globalCss } from '@stitches/react';

const globalStyles = globalCss({
  body: {
    margin: '0',
  },
});

export function App() => {
  globalStyles();
  return <div>Your app</div>
}
```

#### Animations

In Emotion, you can import the `keyframes` function from `@emotion/core`.

In Stitches, you can use the `keyframes` function. Learn more [here](/docs/api#keyframes).

```jsx
// Emotion
import { keyframes } from '@emotion/core';
import style from '@emotion/styled';

const fadeIn = keyframes`
  0% { opacity: 0 }
  100% { opacity: 1 }
`;

const Box = styled.div`
  animation-name: ${fadeIn};
`;

// Stitches
import { keyframes } from '@stitches/react';

const fadeIn = keyframes({
  '0%': { opacity: '0' },
  '100%': { opacity: '1' },
});

const Box = styled('div', {
  animationName: fadeIn,
});
```

#### Server-Side Rendering

In Emotion, there are two ways to server-side render. Each with their own pros and cons. You can read more about it [here](https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr). The default approach is to rely on `renderToString` from `react-dom/server`. The advanced approach is to rely on several packages from `@emotion/core`, `create-emotion-server` and `@emotion/cache`.

In Stitches, you use the `getCssText` function. Learn more about [server-side rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering). Many UI libraries document that responsive variants don't work with server-side rendering. Stitches supports cross-browser server-side rendering, even for responsive styles and variants.

### Behind the scenes

Stitches is a lightweight, performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

#### Performance

Stitches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it more performant than other styling libraries.

Both `@stitches/core` and `@stitches/react` libraries combined weigh in at ~4.7kb gzipped.

#### Developer Experience

Stitches is built on TypeScript. By default, everything you do in Stitches will be type checked. As a user, you'll be suggested autocompletion for CSS Properties, token usage in values, breakpoints and related element attributes. Variants are also typed automatically.

### Wrapping up

When choosing a CSS-in-JS library, keep in mind what your goals are. As demonstrated in this article, both libraries are capable of achieving many of the same goals.
